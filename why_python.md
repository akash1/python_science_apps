- Works with other virtual machines/platforms
    - IronPython/Jython
- Good packaging tool for easy deployment
    - Pyinstaller

# Presenter Notes

- Clients ask for it!
- People are solving big problems with Python
- Space, Weather, Model molecultes, etc.
- This is useful b/c lots of massive computing happens in *nix
- environments so good to have same environment for visualzation and
- number crunching/batch processing.

# Python tools

- Crunch numbers
    - Numpy, scipy, pytables, HDF5
- Visualize
    - 2/3 D plots (PyQt, PyQwt, Pyside, VTK, mayavi, matplotlib)
- Location
    - Esri (ArcPy/geoprocessing)
    - SGeMS (geostatical modeling)
    - SegyPY (geophysical file format)

# Presenter Notes

- Lets go back to requirements of our app
- Esri embraced Python as scripting lang for ArcGIS
