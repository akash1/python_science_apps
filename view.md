## PyQt

- Python bindings to Qt toolkit
- Cross-platform
- Includes GUI, network, XML, SQL, etc.

--------------------------------------------------

# View

## PyQwt

- For science/engineering apps
- Much smaller/faster than matplotlib
- Bad Python docs, use C++ docs

# Presenter Notes

- PySide is LGPL, PyQt is GPL
- PyQt/PyQwt can feel a bit awkward at times b/c they wrap C++ code almost
  directly
