## PyQt/PyQwt

- PyQt
    - Python bindings to Qt toolkit
    - Cross-platform
    - Includes GUI, network, XML, SQL, etc.
- PyQwt
    - Built on PyQt/Qwt for science/engineering apps
    - Much faster than matplotlib
    - Bad Python docs, use C++ docs

# Presenter Notes

- PySide is LGPL, PyQt is GPL
- PyQt/PyQwt can feel a bit awkward at times b/c they wrap C++ code almost
  directly
