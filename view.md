## PyQt

- Python bindings to Qt toolkit
- Cross-platform
- Includes GUI, network, XML, SQL, etc.

# Presenter Notes

- Qt is old and hardened, first release 1992
- PyQt first released around 1998
- Beware of licenses; PySide is LGPL, PyQt is GPL

## PyQwt

- For science/engineering apps
- Much smaller/faster than matplotlib
- Bad Python docs, use C++ docs

# Presenter Notes

- Stable, but not a lot of dev. activity
- Recommending use of pyqtgraph for future
- PyQt/PyQwt can feel a bit awkward at times b/c they wrap C++ code with
  automated tools
