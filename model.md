## PyTables

- Read/write HDF5 files
- Massive data sets
    - In-memory optimization
    - 30 columns and 1 million entries using ~ 13 MB
- No concurrency
- Numpy to boost performance (in memory buffers)
- Think ORM for HDF5

# Presenter Notes

- Mostly C, not RDBMS replacement
- Great community/developer support
