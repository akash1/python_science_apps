# Presenter Notes

- Let's talk about building a desktop app, those still exist right?
- Not all of us are in the cloud yet!
- This is a TOUR, not comprehensive
- Lots of good stuff will be missed
- This isn't a 'how' talk, it's more of a 'where' talk
- Lots of links at the end, worth exploring if you're interested
